**Internship Provider:** Prodigy Infotech  
**Track:** Cybersecurity  
**Task Number:** 02

---

## 🚀 Objective
Develop a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation in Python.

---

## 🧪 How It Works
- Each pixel's RGB values are modified by adding or subtracting a numeric key.
- The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- Supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`.

## 🛠️ Usage
Run the script in a Python environment:
```bash
python image_encryption.py
